# Teaneck Minyanim
This is the code behind [Teaneck Minyanim](https://teaneckminyanim.com) which is a site that lists all of the minyanim in Teaneck, NJ.

The code is designed to automatically update based on the Jewish calendar and preprogrammed rules. 

It is still a work in progress and requires additional work. Please reach out if you are interested in helping devleop the project.
